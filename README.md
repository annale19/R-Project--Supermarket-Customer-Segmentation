# R-Project--Supermarket-Customer-Segmentation
In this project, our objective is to identify the key factors that drive sales performance and customer satisfac- tion as reflected in customer ratings. To achieve this, we analyzed the historical sales data of a supermarket. Specifically, we examined records from three different branches of a supermarket over a three-month period, spanning from December 31, 2018, to March 29, 2019. Our approach involved segmenting customer data based on Gender (Male and Female) and Customer Type (Member and Non-members), allowing us to gain insights into their spending patterns and overall satisfaction.
## Domain of Interest:
The domain of interest is customer segmentation within the retail sector, specifically focusing on supermarket environments. Our primary objective is to extract valuable insights that can inform decision-making processes for retail businesses. By gaining a deeper understanding of customers, these businesses can upgrade their services to meet individual customer needs which can improve sales and service quality. Given the critical role customers play in the retail setting, gaining a deeper understanding of their preferences and behaviors can significantly enhance profit margins and brand image.
